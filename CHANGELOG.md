# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 2.0.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/2.0.0/),
and this project adheres to Calendar Versioning: `vYYYY.MM.DD`, with one release
section per date and same-day changes aggregated in that section.

## [v2026.09.01] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Initial release of b-agentic, providing a Pi workflow kernel, skills, extensions, validation, and installer tooling.
- Add a canonical managed-capability activation contract with trigger, prerequisite, readiness, and fallback guidance, plus a privacy-preserving `/b-status` snapshot that reports local metadata without inspecting MCP credentials or claiming operational LSP readiness.
- Integrate the installer-managed Pi todo extension with unpinned package lifecycle reconciliation, capability/status tracking, installer smoke coverage, and lightweight guidance for tracking non-trivial multi-step work.

### Changed

- Require workers to send reliable terminal results to the assigning planner and defer worktree-changing reviews to planner-owned b-review.
- Document agent-maintained daily changelog updates, including same-day release aggregation and human-facing entries.
- Redesign b-init repository guidance around a concise, evidence-backed operating guide with explicit migration and developer-rule preservation.
- Streamline two-role b-commit execution: the planner makes one exact, user-approved read-only proposal; the same worker resumes the unchanged approved handoff without duplicate approval, and snapshot or proposal mismatches stop the commit.
- Limit root `AGENTS.md` verification guidance to a concise set of normal repository checks.
- Make b-pr-summary render completed PR descriptions with the Markdown preview tool instead of offering an optional preview.
